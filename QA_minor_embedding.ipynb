    "### Summary: Using minorminer to Embed a 64x64 J Matrix Ising Model and Avoid Chain Breaking\n",
    "\n",
    "To embed a 64-variable Ising model (defined by a 64x64 J matrix with couplings from 3e-5 to 0.08) onto a D-Wave QPU while minimizing chain breaking, use `minorminer`’s `find_embedding` function. Chain breaking occurs when physical qubits in a chain (representing one logical variable) misalign, leading to incorrect solutions. Here’s how to use `minorminer` effectively, even offline:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create the Problem Graph**:\n",
    "   - Extract non-zero \\( J_{ij} (i < j) \\) from the J matrix to form a graph where nodes are variables (0 to 63) and edges are couplings.\n",
    "   - Example: A sparse graph (~300 edges) is easier to embed than a fully connected one (2016 edges).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Simulate QPU Topology**:\n",
    "   - Use `dwave_networkx.pegasus_graph(15)` to simulate an Advantage QPU’s Pegasus topology (~5000 qubits, high connectivity), ideal for 64 variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Find Embedding with minorminer**:\n",
    "   - Use `minorminer.find_embedding` with tuned parameters to minimize chain lengths, reducing chain breaking risk:\n",
    "     - `tries=30`: Explore multiple embeddings.\n",
    "     - `chainlength_patience=20`: Prioritize short chains.\n",
    "     - `timeout=180`: Allow time for dense graphs.\n",
    "   - Short chains (max <10, avg <5) lower chain breaking risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Set Chain Strength**:\n",
    "   - Choose a chain strength of 0.1–0.12 (1.25–1.5 × max \\( |J_{ij}| = 0.08 \\)) to keep chains intact without distorting the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Analyze and Save Embedding**:\n",
    "   - Check chain lengths to ensure they’re short. Save the embedding for future QPU sampling.\n",
    "   - If chains are long or embedding fails, sparsify the J matrix (e.g., set \\( J_{ij} < 2e-4 \\) to 0) or use a hybrid solver later.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Future Sampling**:\n",
    "   - When QPU access is available, use `EmbeddingComposite` with the saved embedding and chain strength to sample solutions, checking `chain_break_fraction` to assess chain breaking.\n",
